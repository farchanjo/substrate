# Record architecture decisions

## Context and Problem Statement

The substrate architecture needs a durable, reviewable record of
significant decisions. How should those decisions be captured?

## Considered Options

- MADR 4.0 markdown files under `adr/`
- An external wiki
- No formal record

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "MADR 4.0 markdown files under `adr/`", because the
records live beside the schemas they constrain and are validated by
`spec validate`.
